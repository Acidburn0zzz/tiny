# Tiny

I am on a tiny mission! This WordPress theme is ment to be as small as possible.

* few lines of code - _easliy maintainable_
* no bloating features - _far from plugin territory_
* does not get in the way of plugins - _the way WP is ment to be_


It should also harnest the power of WordPress core to the fullest.

* enable as many core features as possible
* leverage gutenberg
* easily child-themable

Let the mission commence!
